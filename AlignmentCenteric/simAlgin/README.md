##README for the PDTB2 Alignment Tool

---

## 1. Overview

The PDTB2 Alignment Tool provides a streamlined method for extracting aligned segments from an English Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) dataset and its translation in Pidgin. The tool allows users to generate a Pidgin discourse classification dataset that mirrors the structure of the English PDTB data, paving the way for developing sophisticated discourse analysis models for Pidgin.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

- ##Python##: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
- ##Libraries##: The tool requires the `pandas` library. Install using `pip install pandas`.

---

## 3. Data Files

The tool uses multiple data files:
- `pdtb2_pcm.csv`: Contains the English PDTB version 2 data.
- `english.txt`: Contains the full text of the English data.
- `pcm.txt`: Contains the full Pidgin translation of the English text.
- `simAlign_alignments_output.txt`: Contains word alignments between the English and Pidgin texts.
- `variants.csv`: Contains variants of English terms in Pidgin, used for handling misalignments.

---

## 4. Features

- ##Word Alignment##: Using word alignment data, the tool identifies corresponding segments (Arg1, Arg2, Connectives) in the Pidgin translation based on their position in the English text.
  
- ##Alignment Error Handling##: If a term in English can't be aligned with a term in Pidgin, the tool searches for an alternative variant from the `variants.csv` file.

- Data Export: The tool saves the aligned Pidgin segments into structured CSV files, which can be directly used for model training or further analysis.

- Unique Value Analysis: Post-processing, the tool provides a breakdown of unique terms and their occurrences in the aligned dataset.

---

## 5. Usage

To use the PDTB2 Alignment Tool:

1. Ensure all the data files are in the correct directories as referenced in the tool.
2. Run the provided script.
3. Check the generated CSV files and text files in the `align/simAlgin/data/` and `align/simAlgin/data/combined/` directories for the aligned data and unique value breakdowns.

# Data Processing Pipeline README

This README provides an overview of the data processing pipeline for extracting, aligning, and correcting data from the PDTB2.csv file. The pipeline involves several steps, and this document will guide you through each one.

## Step 1: Extract Data from PDTB2.csv

To extract data from PDTB2.csv, you can use the following command:

```bash
python /local/musaeed/general-pidgin-modeling/align/simAlgin/scripts/0_filterdataframe.py /local/musaeed/pdtb2.csv
```

Make sure to replace `/local/musaeed/pdtb2.csv` with the actual path to your PDTB2.csv file. This step will generate the necessary data.

## Step 2: Generate Alignments

Generate alignments between English and Pidgin using `1_alignInferPDTB.py`. Use the following command:

```bash
python 1_alignInferPDTB.py
```

Configure the script with the correct input and output paths for your data.

## Step 3: Extract Arg1 and Arg2 Alignments

To extract Arg1 and Arg2 alignments and replace alignment errors with NaijaLex, you can use the following command:

```bash
python /local/musaeed/general-pidgin-modeling/align/simAlgin/scripts/6_PDTB2TextErrorreplaceAlignmentErrorWithNaijaLex.py
```

Ensure that you configure the script with the correct input and output paths, as well as any other necessary parameters.

## Dependencies

- List any dependencies or libraries required to run the scripts successfully.



You can copy this entire block of text and paste it into a Markdown file named `README.md` in your project repository. Adjust the paths, dependencies, author information, and licensing details according to your project's requirements.


## 6. Limitations

- The tool relies on the accuracy of the alignment data. Incorrect alignments will affect the accuracy of the generated Pidgin dataset.
- For misalignments, the tool currently only searches for variants in the `variants.csv`. There's no guarantee every misalignment will be corrected.
