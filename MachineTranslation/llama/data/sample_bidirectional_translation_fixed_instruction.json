Oral sex wey some pipo sabi as  mouth action  na di major way to spread Human Papiloma Virus (HPV). Dr Adebayo say dem don begin see HPV inside di throat of pipo wey dey do oral sex. Im say na women dey quick catch di virus especially those wey dey allow semen enta dia mouth. Men wey dey like suck woman private part also dey at risk of di disease.  Men Don Tok 3 Words Dem Like To Dey Hear During Sex  Dr Adebayo wey be Gynaecologist for Lagos State General Hospital, Ifako-Ijaiye advice young pipo make dem try go get HPV vaccination as dis one go comot di virus from dia bodi. But e no mean say once dem don do di vaccination, dem fit dey chook mouth inside anybodi private part. Im say di best tin na to stick to one partner wey also dey clean.  Image copyright BB THREE/DAVID WELLER Wen dem ask Dr Adebayo weda condom fit be solution to safe oral sex, im say dat one go reduce di pleasure wey di pesin go feel during di action.  I sure say man wey dey do oral sex go prefer to dey feel di woman tongue directly on im private part and na di same too for woman wey dey use female condom dey do oral sex , di doctor tok. Dr Adebayo say na waste of time to tell young pipo make dem stop to dey do oral sex because dem no go wan hear dat level. Human Papiloma Virus (HPV) na virus wey fit affect pesin skin and oda parts of di bodi like di cervix, mouth, throat and inside pesin bumbum. Different types of HPV dey but genital HPV fit spread give anoda pesin fast-fast, and na from sex pesin fit catch am.Feminism don begin make Nigerian women dey shine eye on top dia rights and many oda wahala wey dey affect dem.  Even as di feminism fight still dey go on strong upon all di yabis wey e dey get, some kain laws for Nigeria still dey slow down di success of dis movement.  University of Nigeria Nsukka Law graduate, Nnanna Emeka na one of di pipo wey dey cari dis feminism fight for head afta im study Feminist Jurisprudence for school.  Nnnanna say e dey shocking wen im see say pipo yakpa wey no know say di constitution dey support laws wey no favour woman.  E use vex enta social media to write some of di Nigerian laws wey im feel say no favour women. Under section 55 (d) of the Nigerian Penal Code, for couples wey dey subject to customary law, husband fit use beating to correct im wife as far as im no give her serious wound wey fit land her for hospital Even though dis law still dey exist, Nigeria release di Violence Against Persons Prohibition Act for 2015. Dis Act dey against different kain violence and offenders fit get serious punishment.  Section 55 of di Nigerian Labour Act no allow women to dey work for night except di woman na nurse Some women feel say dis law dey reduce di money women fit make but Olamide Abe wey be law student for Nigeria tok say di law make sense as e dey protect women.  She no gree say dem make di law to try chance women.  Inside section 353 of di Nigerian Criminal Code, indecent assault on any man na serious crime and di punishment fit reach 3 years for prison.  But under section of dis same Code, indecent assault on woman na just small offence and punishment no fit pass 2 years inside prison.  Under section 26 and 27 of di Nigerian Constitution, only man fit make im foreign wife become Nigerian citizen. Woman no fit try am. Pesin wey wan marry below 21 years go need submit written consent from im papa. Di only time di pesin mama fit write dat kain letter na if di papa no dey again or if di papa head no correct. Na so dem take write am for Section 18 of di Nigerian Marriage Act. Section 6 of di Criminal Code explain say marital rape no be crime for Nigeria. In fact, according to di law, e no dey possible for husband to rape im wife or make wife rape her husband.  Olamide Abe tok say dis law no good because pipo plenti wey dey suffer marital rape. She say di overall rape law for Nigeria just get as e be. Nnanna, like many oda feminists for Nigeria, dey call for laws wey go favour both men and women. Im still add say no be to just make laws but to make sure say pipo dey obey dem.Last week, we knack una tori on how IMDb pick Funke Akindele as Dora Milaje and e no tey, like some days later, we knack una another tori of how dem commot am from the cast "

        "input": "I been dey think say corruption na only money something but as usual Naija government don surprise me again. Few days ago, we hear say our Presido, Mohammadu Buhari win leadership award from Dr. Martin Luther King Jnr. family dem. The news start from Buhari social media pages wey dey managed by Lauretta Onochie. ALSO READ: Timaya Buy New House Worth Over 500 Million (Pictures) The news wey dem feed us be say dem give presido the award sake of say he dey fight corruption and make he keep up the good work.   As e be so, the King family do respond say no be dem give Buhari award say dem no even send anybody to give him award. ANOTHER TORI: NNPC Collect Most Valued Company Award For Naija  Na so we see am too. Dem dey use corruption to dey award anti-corruption.President Muhammadu Buhari office don hala say na fake news say Nigeria goment give order to freeze of bank accounts of main opposition PDP Vice Presidential candidate Peter Obi.  But di confusion wey follow di freezing of opposition vice presidential candidate Peter Obi, bank account unto say di kontri corruption police -EFCC and ICPC draw bodi comot say dem no get hand for di mata, don reach to ask di kweshion, na who and who get power to freeze bank accounts for Nigeria?  Garba Shehu, di tok tok pesin for President Muhammadu Buhari wey post di goment position for twitter also say na lie say goment give EFCC order to raid di house of pikins of opposition presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar. E get some institutions wey get power to freeze accounts for Nigeria and dem include, Federal Inland Revenue Services (FIRS), Nigeria Courts and Central Bank of Nigeria.  According to di Section 34 of di 2004 Act (inside di laws of Nigeria) wey set up di Economic and Financial Commission, di chairman fit give authority to im official to freeze account. Section 7 say dem go need court oder to fit freeze bank accounts. But, Former Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Deputy govnor, Obadiah Mailafia say,  to dey honest wit you, dem no really get power again.  Di reason for dia be say, wen dem first create EFCC for 2004, e bin get one unit wey dem dey call, National Financial Intelligence Unit, wey all banks dey automatically registered wit. Dis unit na im bin give EFCC power as dem fit freeze bank account wit or witout court order. But, dis unit dey autonomous now, as dem no dey under EFCC again. Inside di law wey create Federal Inland Revenue Service alias FIRS Act, section 31 give am power to use agent of tax payer to helep am recover tax wey di person or company no gree pay. Di agent fit be bank. For FIRS to freeze account, it must dey related to tax mata, according to sabi pesin for moni mata. Nigeria courts na im dey in charge of all di laws of di kontri and dem get power to oder any goment organisation or bank to freeze account. In fact, all di oda institutions wey get power to freeze account go need to get court oder before dem fit do dis assignment. ICPC Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) wey be Nigeria anti-corruption agency also get power to freeze any pesin bank account wey den suspect say im dey involved for financial crime. But to do am dem gatz go to court to get oda. CBN Central Bank of Nigeria get power to freeze account wey im suspect say na criminal get am or dem dey use am for moni laundering.  If CBN believe say di account dey against some of im guidelines and directive, dem go close di account witout court oda, but dis kain tin no too dey happun, Mailafia tok. On Saturday December 8, tok tok pesin, and director of media plus publicity of presidential campaign council for opposition parti PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, do announcement say one of di kontri corruption police don freeze all di bank accounts of Vice President candidate Peter Obi. Nigerian banks? Nigeria banks no get any power at all to freeze account. Dia own n just to obey court oda on top di mata. Mailafia say, if any bank freeze any account, di owner of di account must  force di bank to tok who give am di oder to freeze di account. For 1975, World Health Organisation (WHO) declare say malaria no dey di Europe again but now dia focus dey on how to do di same for Africa. Wetin fit make dem succeed? Malaria, di disease wey dey kill pipo pass any oda one for di world, bin kill plenty pipo for Europe around 1950s before WHO decide say dem go chook mouth for di mata with di Global Malaria Eradication Programme, and 20 years later, no single European sick from malaria again. Na United States bin first decide for 1947 say e don do for malaria to dey kill dia pipo, so dem put plan down to end am. 3 years later, for 1951, US crush malaria pata-pata. Today, na Africa get di highest number of malaria cases for di world and Nigeria na di number one kontri wey carry am pass.  Di fight to end malaria for Africa by goments and international community don dey go on now, no be mata of 20 years.  As today be World Malaria Day, di question to ask na why e be say to end malaria for Africa hard to do?  When US and Europe decide to end malaria, dem make sure say rule dey ground to make sure say everybodi dey involve in di program. Dis one mean say goment support dey and pipo know wetin dem dey try achieve. Dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) wey bi one white chemical wey get power to kill mosquitoes even when di spraying don stop.  US and WHO use dis DDT to take kill mosquitoes during dia programs. But years later, dem ban DDT because e dey affect plant in a bad way and di mosquitoes sef don find way to shake bodi for di medicine. Money get hand for di mata. One of di reason why for 1955 WHO no fit carry dia Global Malaria Eradication Programme come Africa na because money no reach to take arrange transport of materials and pipo come di continent.  And after Europe deal with dia malaria palava finish, WHO report say money contribution don reduce and so dem end di program for 1969. Some even say, because western kontries no get malaria again, e no dey chook dem for bodi to help Africa with money, instead dem prefer to contribute for AIDS.  AIDS dey affect pipo everywhere for di world. Di last tin wey make malaria eradication work na di collabo wey dey between di different kontris wey dey involve because without dis one, one kontri fit dey do one tin while di neighbour kontri fit dey do anoda tin.  And di way malaria be, pesin wey get malaria fit carry am enta anoda kontri, and like dat all di work wey di kontri don do to end malaria go do u-turn. WHO don say plan dey with support from Global Fund and Di Gates Foundation to put money down to end malaria for di world by 2040. Also, dem go need support from all goments to join hand at di same time to achieve am. But for now, WHO advice say make pipo dey sleep inside net wey dem do to kill mosquitoes and to use Artemisinin-based combination (ACTs) medicine for treatment.Ogoni people don give federal government December ultimatum make dem begin do something for the Ogoni cleanup or else wahala go de Movement of the Survival of Ogoni People (MOSSOP) do press conference for Portharcourt wey de Rivers state talk say government never do anything for the Ogoni cleanup say dem don abandon dem.
